# WhatsApp-Webste Clone
 Complete Responsive WhatsApp Website Using HTML CSS and JS. I've made this project for educational purposes to teach my students on My YouTube Channel.  " TechWA "
I have only developed the front page of the orignal website and made it completely responsive as the orignal website. 
I have developed this site by using simple CSS Techniques like Flex Box and CSS Grid.
Sliding menu for the responsive site is made using CSS animation.
I have used the orignal pictures and colors used in the orignal site www.whatsapp.com

Note: There were no bad intention while copying and cloning this website. It was done only for educational purposes as I was requested to make a clone of this particular website by my students.
